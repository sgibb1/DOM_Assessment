# DOM_Assessment

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Make an empty HTML file, put an empty main tag inside the body.

In your JavaScript, use querySelector to get a reference to the main tag and save it in a variable named main.

Look up three good jokes and store them as separate variables in your JavaScript.

Define an HTML template with a template string. Make a heading for your template that says "My Jokes" and make a list of your three jokes, inserting the variables as items in the list.

Put the template inside the main tag.

Make a paragraph tag with the document.createElement method and save it to a variable.

Add the text "That's all folks!" as text content to the newly created paragraph tag.

Append the paragraph tag to the body tag of your HTML page.
